   My Rmd lecture notes setup, designed for exporting to both HTML and PDF
   formats. Takes care of things like consistent multi-column environments and
   regression table output, support for non-standard fonts in figures, nice
   affiliation typesetting for PDF format, etc. Thanks a lot to grantmcdermott.
